      Hi! I am a CS student at Queen's University who's currently navigating the
      complex world of web development and shedding tears over the chaotic
      JavaScript ecosystem (seriously though why is it like this ðŸ˜­). When I'm
      not busy coding, you'll find me indulging in my love for philosophy,
      psychology, music, and personal development!

      What is common amongst almost all my interest is that I am fundamentally
      drawn towards understanding things from the ground up. In tech, this means
      understanding how our technologies work under the hood. In life, it means
      answering questions that serve as a foundation for all other questions. I
      simply have a strong passion for learning how things work and it never
      ceases to amaze me how much complexity we are abstracting away on a daily
      basis.

      I am still very much in the process of learning web development, and
      probably will forever be! I personally enjoy the simplicity of the core
      languages (HTML/CSS/JS) and have built several simple projects with them.
      Currently, I am learning NextJS for full-stack development and Astro for
      creating simple and elegant websites.
